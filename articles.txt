My home town is a beautiful place. It stands beside a wide river and is rich in fish and rice.
But in the old days it was a poor and backward little town. Many people had no work. They lived a hard life.
In 1949 my hometown was liberated. Since then great changes have taken place there. The streets have been widened. Factories, schools, hospitals, cinemas and theatres have sprung up one after another. The life of the people is greatly improved.
I love my hometown. All the more I love its people. They are working hard so as to make it still richer and more beautiful.

However, what they did makes others look down upon them. If everyone behaves in this way, the world will be a big rubbish dump with flies flying round and people will live in a world of diseases. Besides, it will be impossible for dustmen to clean the world woth such people living in it.

Nowadays weight-losing has become popular among young and middle-aged women. In order to make themselves pretty-looking, they try many different ways of losing weight. Some go on a diet, some take exercise,some eat medicine ,others even turn to operation for help. As a result,a lot of products have come into being,such as special medicines, tea and equipment. They are used in different ways and work differently, but some have side effects.
In my opinion, its understandable that women seek beauty, but they should do it in a proper way. Taking exercise is the way that I most favor. But the other methods are likely to do harm to peoples health more or less.

Hi! Tom
Nice to read your e-mail today. I noticed you’ve begun to use Chinese idioms and used most of them correctly.
However, I’m afraid there is one mistake I’d like to point out. It is “无所不为”. This idiom means “do all kinds of bad things”. Are you doing all kinds of bad things at home? I guess what you were really trying to say is that you’ve got nothing to do these days. In that case, you should use “无所事事” . We usually use “无所不为” to express the idea that people dare to do anything bad, and “无所事事” to describe the situation in which people have got nothing meaningful to do. Have I made myself clear?
Anyway, I’m amazed at the progress you’ve made.
Hop you’ll find a good job soon.

So, nearly every time they have new task, they have to work overtime.
Sometimes they have to work over night.
Of course, there are some peoples job property is similar to designer also need to work anextra shift.
Thus, I think the people like designer will have more chances to work overtime.

As we came to the crossroads a young man and a girl came up and stopped us. “Weve found you at long last,” they said. But we didnt know them. Pointing to a policeman not far away, the young man explained, “He stopped us about half an hour ago and made us catch the next offender. So come on, stand here.

Poisons to kill pests in farming and chemicals go into rivers and seas, too. Poisonous gasses from factories also make the air so dirty. The whole balance of nature is being destroyed as a result of our ignorance of the environmental protection. Personally, man can not live alone on the earth.

In your spoken English class, your teacher shows you the following picture. You are asked to describe the picture and explain how you understand it.
What an interesting picture! A western young man, sitting at a table, is ready to eat a bowl of noodles. He is holding two forks the same way as we Chinese hold chopsticks. He is trying so hard to pick up the noodles that he is sweating a lot. At first glance, I think it’s a bit funny, for we Chinese take for granted that chopsticks are the tools for eating noodles. The man in the picture is trying to copy us. Obviously he is doing it the hard way. Maybe using one fork will do a better job, In my opinion, we don’t need to copy others’ ways of thinking. Sometimes a simpler way of doing things may be a better way.

Cactuses are used to living in desert. The whole body of a cactus is green. The stalk is oval and there are thorns all over its body. Actually the thorns in their bodies are their leaves. The leaves are like this only because they can stop the water in their bodies from evaporating into the hot and dry air. The cactuses have long roots and they take their roots deep into the earth so that they can get the water from deeper,soil. Their flowers are always small and white.
仙人掌通常生长在沙漠里。它通身绿色。它的茎是椭圆形的.，并且全身长满刺，实际上它们身上的刺是它们的叶子。叶于长成这种形状是为了阻止它们身体内的水分蒸发到热而干的空气里。仙人掌长着长长的根，它们把根深深地扎入地底下以便从更深层的土中吸收水分。
Although they are ignored in the desert, they never give up coming ont and alwaysdecorate the desert silently.
它们一般开小而白的花。尽管它们在沙漠里被忽视，但是它们从不放弃开花并且默默地点缀着沙漠。

Last Thursday，we had a class meeting to discuss where to go for our spring outing。 We came up with several choices such as going boating，climbing a mountain，and going to an amusement park。 Finally，we decided to go mountain climbing。
The next day，we set off early in the morning。 While climbing the mountain，we enjoyed the warm sunshine and a beautiful view 。 However，when we reached the top，we were shocked to see litter here and there，such as bottles and banana peels。 Then we started to pick up the litter and put the rubbish into the nearby recycling bin and non—recycling bin respectively。
We were tired but happy。

There are many violences and romances on television today, you can find them in almost every channel. This phenomenon is caused by the TV stations want to get higher audience rating, therefore, they tend to use scenes which can exite the audience, violence and romance have this kind of characteristic, that can attract more people to watch their channel. I think that the violences and romances on TV might have very bad affection at teenagers, they might act like the ones do on TV, this may increase crimes. The drive of interest contributes to more and more firms and companies producing these kind of stuffs, and in a market economy, no one has the right to stop them, therefore, there are still so many these stuffs on TV.

Everyone knows that failure always accompanies us in our life. No matter what we do,none of us can say we will surely succeed,because there is no such thing as plain sailing.About failure,different people have different opinions. Generally speaking,on one hand,people think "failure is the mother of success".
They think we wont understand the profound meaning of success until we go through failure. On the other hand,for some people,failure is frustration. They think if a person goes through too much failure,he will collapse and lose confidence in his life.In my opinion,failure is the footstone and catalyst of the edifice of success. "
You dont know what you have until its gone." If you have never lost it,and always get it easily,you will not cherish what you get and own.

In recent years, studying abroad has been popular. Tens of thousands of Chinese students have gone to foreign countries to study. Many people are trying their best to apply to go abroad.
There are many advantages in attending schools abroad. First, students who have studied abroad can act as mediators between people of different cultures. Second, we can learn much more advanced knowledge of science and technology from foreign countries. Third, we can learn foreign languages more quickly.
However, there are some disadvantages. Most of the students are too young to live by themselves without any living experience. Besides, being far away from their home country, they may feel lonely and homesick. Of course the costs are much.

In the picture, we can see a boy in worn clothes, sitting at a shabby wooden table with a pile of books on it. A weak ray of light came in through a small hole in the wall and he was absorbed in his reading.
This is a well-known story from an ancient Chinese idiom. The boy, being poor, ccfflldnt afford even a candle, so he bored a hole in the wall to "steal" light from his neighbors house to read at night. The moral of the story is: spare no effort to acquire knowledge and never get discouraged easily no matter how difficult the situation may be.
Of course, things are totally different today. It is not the story itself but what is reflected in the story that counts. Hard work pays off. We should take pains to improve ourselves through learning and get prepared for the future.

人们总以为淡水是取之不尽的，实际上淡水资源是很有限的。请谈谈你的`看法。
It is generally believed that there is a good supply of fresh water. But to our disappointment, the fact is just the opposite.
As we can see, the world population is growing rapidly day by day. So enough fresh water is needed to feed such a big population. Whats more, with the development of industry, factories and vehicles produce poisonous gases or wastes, which consequently results in the pollution of water. Though fresh, a good amount of it can no longer be used. Only quite limited fresh water resource is available to human beings. So its high time for us human beings to take quick action to protect water resource. Stop pollution and save water, otherwise, we cannot survive on the earth.
With fresh water, the world will be prosperous. (130words)

Hi Sharon,
This is Li Xia. I learned from your post that you want to improve your Mandarin. I feel honored to have the chance to help you with your Mandarin learning and I am very happy to have you as my English teacher. Im good at speaking standard Mandarin. Ive been a broadcaster in the school’s broadcasting station for years. When it comes to how to speak fluent Mandarin, I suggest that you learn a bunch of pronunciation rules first, which are quite different from the English ones. Another suggestion is to practice speaking. As the saying goes, “Practice makes perfect”. However, my English is just OK and I have many problems with my study. I really hope that you can give me good advice on how to study English well. I believe we both can make much progress with each others’ help.
Thank you!
